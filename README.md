# validator-plugin-aws
The AWS [validator](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator) plugin ensures that your AWS environment matches a user-configurable expected state.

## Description
The AWS validator plugin reconciles `AwsValidator` custom resources to perform the following validations against your AWS environment:

1. Compare the IAM permissions associated with an IAM user / group / role / policy against an expected permission set
2. Compare the usage for a particular service quota against the active quota
3. Compare the tags associated with a subnet against an expected tag set

Each `AwsValidator` CR is (re)-processed every two minutes to continuously ensure that your AWS environment matches the expected state.

See the [samples](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator-plugin-aws/tree/main/config/samples) directory for example `AwsValidator` configurations.

## Authn & Authz
Authentication details for the AWS validator controller are provided within each `AwsValidator` custom resource. AWS authentication can be configured either implicitly or explicitly. All supported options are detailed below:
* Implicit (`AwsValidator.auth.implicit == true`)
  * [IAM roles for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)
  * [IAM roles for Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html)
  * [IAM roles for Service Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) (OIDC)
    * In this scenario, a valid Service Account must be specified during plugin installation. See [values.yaml](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator-plugin-aws/blob/main/chart/validator-plugin-aws/values.yaml) for details.
* Explicit (`AwsValidator.auth.implicit == false && AwsValidator.auth.secretName != ""`)
  * [Environment variables](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#environment-variables)
  * Environment variables + [role assumption via AWS STS](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/stscreds#AssumeRoleOptions)

> [!NOTE]
> See [values.yaml](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator-plugin-aws/tree/main/chart/validator-plugin-aws/values.yaml) for additional configuration details for each authentication option.

### Minimal AWS managed IAM permission policies by validation type
For validation to succeed, certain AWS managed permission policies must be attached to the principal used and/or assumed by the AWS validator controller. The minimal required IAM policies, broken out by validation category, are as follows:
* IAM
  * `IAMReadOnlyAccess`
* Service Quotas
  * `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`
  * `AmazonElasticFileSystemReadOnlyAccess`
  * `ElasticLoadBalancingReadOnly`
  * `ServiceQuotasReadOnlyAccess`
* Tags
  * `AmazonVPCReadOnlyAccess`

> [!NOTE]
> Validation *can* be successful with custom IAM policies that are even more restrictive than the AWS managed policies listed above, but these will vary on a case-by-case basis and hence are undocumented for the sake of maintainability.

## Supported Service Quotas by AWS Service
EC2:
- EC2-VPC Elastic IPs
- Public AMIs

EFS:
- File systems per account

ELB:
- Application Load Balancers per Region
- Classic Load Balancers per Region
- Network Load Balancers per Region

VPC:
- Internet gateways per Region
- Network interfaces per Region
- VPCs per Region
- NAT gateways per Availability Zone
- Subnets per VPC

## Installation
The AWS validator plugin is meant to be [installed by validator](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator/tree/gh_pages#installation) (via a ValidatorConfig), but it can also be installed directly as follows:

```bash
helm repo add validator-plugin-aws https://spectrocloud-labs.github.io/validator-plugin-aws
helm repo update
helm install validator-plugin-aws validator-plugin-aws/validator-plugin-aws -n validator-plugin-aws --create-namespace
```

## Development
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [kind](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/validator-plugin-aws:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/validator-plugin-aws:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)
